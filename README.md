# R-Project
This project aimed to analyze a financial data set using R programming language and association rules algorithm. This project includes several steps, including data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building an association rules model. This model was used to identify patterns and relationships between data set variables and generate actionable insights for investors and financial analysts. The results of the analysis showed that the association rules algorithm is effective in identifying interesting patterns and relationships in the financial data set. The model identified several rules that can be used to guide investment decisions, such as the relationship between profitability ratios and stock prices.
